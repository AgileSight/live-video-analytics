# Event-based video recording to Assets based on specific objects being detected by external inference engine

This topology enables you to extend the Media graph by interfacing it with an External AI module, relaying inference events from the AI to be published onto the Iot Edge Hub. Additonally, an external edge module triggers the graph to record media assets in the cloud. The trigger to generate these clips is based on the AI inference events published onto the Hub. You can read more about the scenario in this documentation page.
