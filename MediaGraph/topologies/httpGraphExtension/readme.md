# HTTP Graph extension for inferencing
This topology enables you to extend the Media graph by interfacing it with an External AI module. In addition, the graph collects the inference events from the external AI module and pusblishes them onto the Hub. You can read more about the continuous video recording scenario in this documentation page.
