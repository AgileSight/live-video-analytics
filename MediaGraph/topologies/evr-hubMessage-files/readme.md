# Record videos to files based on messages via hub source

This topology enables you to generate video clips on the local file system of the edge device whenever an external sensor sends a message to the hub source. You can read more about this scenario in the documentation page. The diagram below shows a door sensor but it could be any sensor or app sending the message.
